#Description

To start the challenge using IRC, you must send a private message to bot Candy : !ep1. The bot replies with a message in private with a string like this:

<number1>/<number2>

- You must calculate the square root of the number n°1 and multiply the result by the number n°2.

- Then you need to round to two decimals.

- You have 2 seconds to send the correct answer from the time the bot gets the message !ep1

- If the bot does not respond, then you have been banned. Just wait a few minutes.

- The answer must be sent as :

!ep1 -rep <answer>.

Example :

25/2

You must send "!ep1 -rep <reponse>" as private message to the bot.
