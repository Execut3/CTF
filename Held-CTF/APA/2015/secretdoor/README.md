**Description:**

There's this crazy friend of mine that recently got into web designing using php and sql. he also created a page for a company. but he said that he can access to anyfile in anyplace whenever he wants, when he is logged in his account. can you find the backdoor in this page that can access to files in another directories. and I almost forgot, his name is 'john'. it's not it's login name, but sure you can find it. and remember your job is to read me the /home/flag.txt file!!!
