#### 1-1- BinaryCodes
In this repository I tried to put some of challenges developed by myself just for fun.
All challenges include Deployment guide and docker instruction to run the challenge environment.
Also Solution and writeup for each challenge is provided. 

These challenges are really fun and include multiple bugs in the same challenge and you should do a sequence of actions to get the flag.

**Note:** One of the most fun challenges is: https://github.com/Execut3/Held-CTF/tree/master/BinaryCodes/Web/hard-ssrf1
