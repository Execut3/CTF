So if you are the leader of your team, you should create your own team, and please make sure that you enter the correct email for your team. but if you’re not a leader you have two options: 1) look for available teams and send a request for membership to the leader of those teams, and wait for leaders to accept, first one that accepts, you will be a part of that team. 2) or you can ask the leader of your team to give you the join-code for the team. with that join-code you can easily connect to your team.

		4 – After the game is started, nobody can register, create a new team, or even join another team

		5 – each user that tries to attack our servers, make fake requests, or any of this kind of activities will be banned or at-least will be out of the game for a period of time
