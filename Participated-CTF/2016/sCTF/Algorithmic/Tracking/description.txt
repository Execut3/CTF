/**
 * Created for sCTF 2016 Q1
 *
 * This file describes the input file for "Tracking", and the task you will complete.
 *
 * Input values:
 *
 *          +-------+---------------------------+
 *          | d_{1} | distance from satellite A |
 *          +-------+---------------------------+
 *          | d_{2} | distance from satellite B |
 *          +-------+---------------------------+
 *          | d_{3} | distance from satellite C |
 *          +-------+---------------------------+
 *          | d_{4} | distance from satellite D |
 *          +-------+---------------------------+
 *
 * The input file contains the distances in the following order:
 *
 *                 d_{1}, d_{2}, d_{3}, d_{4}
 *
 * The following system of equations (LaTeX) describes the relationship between
 * the four distances and the xyz coordinate:
 *
 *      d_{1}^2=x^2+y^2+z^2
 *      d_{2}^2=(x-p)^2+y^2+z^2
 *      d_{3}^2=(x-q)^2+(y-r)^2+z^2
 *      d_{4}^2=(x-s)^2+(y-t)^2+(z-u)^2
 *
 * To satisfy the equations above, use this info about the satellites:
 *
 *      Satellite A lies on the origin          (0, 0, 0)
 *      Satellite B lies on the x-axis          (p, 0, 0)
 *      Satellite C lies on the xy-plane        (q, r, 0)
 *      Satellite D lies on an arbitrary point  (s, t, u)
 *
 * All satellite locations will be given to you in the input file.
 *
 * Your task is to calculate the x, y, z coordinates that correspond to each individual line of input, then submit
 * the average of those values, rounded up.
 *
 * For Example:
 *
 *      Coordinate 1: (2, 3, 4)             xAvg = Math.ceil((2 + 2 + 5 + 4 + 5) / 5) = 4
 *      Coordinate 2: (2, 6, 3)
 *      Coordinate 3: (5, 2, 3)     --->    yAvg = Math.ceil((3 + 6 + 2 + 2 + 2) / 5) = 3
 *      Coordinate 4: (4, 2, 4)
 *      Coordinate 5: (5, 2, 6)             zAvg = Math.ceil((4 + 3 + 3 + 4 + 6) / 5) = 4
 *
 *               In this example, the flag you submit would be sctf{4, 3, 4}
