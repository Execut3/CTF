	<h1>Welcome to my 0ldsk00l blog.</h1>
	<p>
		Now this is some oldskool classic shit. Writing your blog manually without all this crappy bling-bling CSS / JS stuff.
	</p>

	<h2>2016</h2>
	<p>
		It's 2016 now and I need to somehow keep track of my changes to this document as it grows and grows. All people are talking about a tool called 'Git'. I think I might give this a try.
	</p>

	<h2>1990-2015</h2>
	<p>
		Hmm, looks like totally forgot about this page. I should start blogging more often.
	</p>

	<h2>1990</h2>
	<p>
		I proudly present to you the very first browser for the World Wide Web. Feel free to use it to view my awesome blog.
	</p>

	<h2>1989</h2>
	<p>
		So, yeah, I decided to invent the World Wide Web and now I'm sitting here and writing this.
