Can I Say Something Really Funny? No i'm not in the mood for it. 
Just find the flag sharing server on my local network of 11.10.10.0/24.

**hints:**
- Always try to read the source first.
- Git is your friend.


## level: **hard** 

It's a private network. Access local network and exploit the bug. You will be rewarded with flag :)

to run it:

```
docker-compose up -d
```
